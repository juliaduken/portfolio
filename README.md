### Projects
#### Empowering Greene County: A Study for Workforce Development and Community Prosperity
##### CMU/The Community Foundation of Greene County (CFGC)
I worked with a team of four to design and implement a study to help the CFGC better suit its scholarships and grant opportunities to community members wanting to live in Greene County. The CFGC perceived that scholarship recipients were often leaving the county to pursue professional careers and wished to learn more about the Greene County Career and Technology Center (CTC) students and alumni to increase their reach at the CTC. Through conducting this study, the team learned about where these students and alumni want to live, work, and pursue careers, and used this data to inform workforce development programs and training opportunities in the community. During this project, the team developed a proposal for the aims of our engagement, survey questions & data analysis, focus interview questions, a final deliverable, and two presentations. In addition to collaborating with the team on all aspects of the project, I processed survey data and developed visualizations using R, Python, and Lucidchart.
